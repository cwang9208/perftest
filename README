1. Notes on Testing Methodology
===============================================================================
- The latency benchmarks measure round-trip time but report half of that as one-way
  latency. This means that the results may not be accurate for asymmetrical configurations.

===============================================================================
2. Benchmarks Description
===============================================================================

The benchmarks are not designed to emulate any real application traffic.
Real application traffic may be affected by many parameters, and hence
might not be predictable based only on the results of those benchmarks.

ib_send_lat 	latency test with send transactions
ib_write_lat 	latency test with RDMA write transactions

3. Running Tests
===============================================================================

Server:		./<test name> <options>
Client:		./<test name> <options> <server IP address>

		o  <server address> is IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can use the IPoIB
                   address if IPoIB is configured.
		o  --help lists the available <options>

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE:
      The SAME OPTIONS must be passed to both server and client.

Common Options to all tests:
----------------------------
  -s, --size=<size>			Size of message to exchange (default: 1)
  -a, --all				Run sizes from 2 till 2^23
