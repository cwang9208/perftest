1. Notes on Testing Methodology
===============================================================================
- The latency benchmarks measure round-trip time but report half of that as one-way
  latency. This means that the results may not be accurate for asymmetrical configurations.

===============================================================================
2. Benchmarks Description
===============================================================================

The benchmarks are not designed to emulate any real application traffic.
Real application traffic may be affected by many parameters, and hence
might not be predictable based only on the results of those benchmarks.

ib_send_lat 	latency test with send transactions
ib_write_lat 	latency test with RDMA write transactions

===============================================================================
3. Running Tests
===============================================================================

Server:		./<test name> <options>
Client:		./<test name> <options> <server IP address>

		o  <server address> is IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can use the IPoIB
                   address if IPoIB is configured.
		o  --help lists the available <options>

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE:
      The SAME OPTIONS must be passed to both server and client.

Common Options to all tests:
----------------------------
  -s, --size=<size>			Size of message to exchange (default: 1)
  -a, --all				Run sizes from 2 till 2^23

  --ipv6  Use IPv6 GID. Default is IPv4

SEND tests (ib_send_lat or ib_send_bw) flags: 
---------------------------------------------

  -g, --mcg=<num_of_qps>  	Send messages to multicast group with <num_of_qps> qps attached to it
  -M, --MGID=<multicast_gid>		In multicast, uses <multicast_gid> as the group MGID

----------------------------------------------
Special feature detailed explanation in tests:
----------------------------------------------

  1. Multicast support in ib_send_lat and in ib_send_bw
     Send tests have built in feature of testing multicast performance, in verbs level.
     You can use "-g" to specify the number of QPs to attach to this multicast group.
     "-M" flag allows you to choose the multicast group address.

===============================================================================
4. Known Issues
===============================================================================

 1. Multicast support in ib_send_lat and in ib_send_bw is not stable.
    The benchmark program may hang or exhibit other unexpected behavior.
